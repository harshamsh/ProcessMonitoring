# ProcessMonitoring
Using the artificial neural network technique with the backpropagation method to monitor the industrial process with the multivariable systems.
The system studied is a heat exchanger and represents a multivariable problem. To detect outliers in a multivariable system is not an easy task. With the development in the area of machine learning and knowledge mining algorithms it is possible to use
this data more usefully. In general, we have Classification and Regression as two basic approaches. 
Multiclass classification is used to classify the data from each sensor in the process. Multiclass
classification is a machine learning classification task that consists of more than two classes or outputs. 
Regression is a method of modelling a target value based on independent predictors. 
This method is mostly used for forecasting and finding out cause and effect relationship between variables. 
Regression techniques mostly differ based on the number of independent variables and the type of relationship between the independent and dependent variables. 
The technique used in this project is able to identify this kind of error. 
The methodology employed involves construction of a reliable neural network model to represent the process and its training with a few iterations (a few thousand). 
Thus, the points at which errors between the experimental and calculated data appear to be scattered
far from the majority of the values are probably outliers.
